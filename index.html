<p>Fetch is used to view the changes in the tracked brach/repo</p>
<p>fit fetch origin/master</p>
<p>git diff origin/master : to view the difference made in the repo</p>
<p>git merge origin/master : it is used to merge the changes</p>
<p>after git merge check the status and commit the changes</p>
<p>git pull is a combination of fetch and merge. If you want to directly update the changes to the local repo with fetch and merge.</p>
<p>git push: it to push the changes from local repo to github url/remote github</p>
<p>Git push origin</p>
<p>research123</p>
